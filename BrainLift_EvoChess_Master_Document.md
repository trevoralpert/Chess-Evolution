## üéØ Executive Summary

**EvoChess** is a groundbreaking reimagination of chess that transforms the traditional 8x8 board into a living 3D spherical battlefield. Players command evolving armies of chess pieces across a 20x8 globe grid, where strategic positioning meets evolutionary progression in real-time multiplayer combat.

### Key Innovations:
- **Spherical Gameplay**: Chess on a globe with wraparound mechanics and polar dynamics
- **Evolution System**: Pieces gain power through combat and strategic achievements
- **Real-time Mechanics**: 7-second move timers create continuous action
- **Dice-based Contests**: Underdogs can challenge stronger pieces with tactical risk
- **Multiplayer Excellence**: Up to 8 players, tournaments, lobbies, and spectator modes
- **AI Integration**: Multiple difficulty levels with distinct personalities
- **Professional 3D Models**: Custom GLB pieces with unique designs [[memory:3350199]]

### Development Philosophy:
Built as part of the G2P5 Game Week challenge, this project demonstrates how AI-augmented developers can rapidly master unfamiliar technologies (Three.js, Socket.io) to create production-quality multiplayer games that rival traditional development timelines.

## üåê Game Concept & Innovation

### The Spherical Revolution

Traditional chess is constrained by its rectangular board and linear movement. EvoChess shatters these limitations:

1. **Globe Dynamics**
   - 20 latitude rings √ó 8 longitude lines create 160 positions
   - Longitude wraps around seamlessly (moving east from position 7 leads to position 0)
   - Polar regions create unique strategic considerations
   - No edge constraints - every position has full movement potential

2. **Spatial Innovation**
   - Players spawn at opposite poles or distributed positions
   - North/South movement changes strategic value based on latitude
   - Circumnavigation mechanics reward global thinking
   - Territory control matters across the entire sphere

3. **Visual Excellence**
   - Alternating blue/red grid pattern for clear position identification
   - Pole caps distinguish spawn regions
   - Enhanced lighting system for piece visibility
   - Smooth camera controls for 360¬∞ viewing

### Breaking Chess Conventions

- **No Turns**: Real-time movement with individual cooldowns
- **Evolution**: Pieces transform and gain abilities through gameplay
- **Multi-Battle**: Up to 8 players in massive sphere-wide conflicts
- **Persistence**: Statistics tracking and progression systems

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Starting Configuration

Each player begins with:
- **1 King**: Positioned at their spawn pole (row 0 or 19)
- **8 Pawns**: Arranged in a perfect ring around the King at the next latitude

Spawn distribution for multiplayer:
- 2 players: North and South poles (optimal opposition)
- 3-8 players: Distributed across strategic latitudes

### Movement System

#### Real-time Mechanics
- **7-second cooldown** per player after each move
- **Move queuing**: Plan your next move while on cooldown
- **Collision detection**: Simultaneous moves to same position trigger battles
- **No turn order**: All players act independently

#### Grid Navigation
- **Latitude** (North-South): 20 rows, no wraparound
- **Longitude** (East-West): 8 columns with seamless wraparound
- **Diagonal movement**: Combines latitude and longitude changes
- **Polar dynamics**: Special movement rules at poles (rows 0 and 19)

### Battle System

#### Automatic Resolution
When pieces meet, battles resolve based on point values:
- Higher value automatically defeats lower value
- Equal values trigger dice battle
- Kings always win when attacking (but vulnerable when defending)

#### Contest Mechanics
When a lower-value piece attacks a higher-value piece:
1. **Contest Prompt**: Defender gets 2-10 seconds to decide
2. **Accept Contest**: Dice battle ensues
3. **Decline Contest**: Automatic resolution (attacker loses)

#### Dice Battle Rules
- Each player rolls dice equal to their piece's point value
- **Highest single die wins** (not sum)
- Ties broken by successive single-die rolls
- Splitter-weakened pieces lose 1 die

### Evolution Points System

#### Earning Evolution Points
- **Combat Victory**: +1 point (more for defeating stronger pieces)
- **Circumnavigation**: +8 points (Pawns/Splitters reaching opposite pole)
- **Defeating Splitters**: +1 bonus point
- **Strategic Achievements**: Various bonuses

#### Banking System
- Points accumulate in player's evolution bank
- Right-click any piece to view evolution options
- Choose strategic upgrades based on battlefield needs
- 30-second decision window for evolution choices

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Piece Types & Evolution System

### Starting Pieces

| Piece | Points | Movement | Special Ability |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **King** | 3 | Omnidirectional (1 square) | Game-ending piece, wins all attacks |
| **Pawn** | 1 | Forward only, diagonal attacks | Can evolve multiple ways, circumnavigation bonus |

### Traditional Chess Pieces

| Piece | Points | Movement | Evolution Cost |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Bishop** | 3 | Diagonal (unlimited) | From Pawn: 4 pts + 60s alive |
| **Knight** | 3 | L-shaped jumps | From Pawn: 3 pts |
| **Rook** | 5 | Orthogonal (unlimited) | From Pawn: 4 pts + 60s alive |
| **Queen** | 9 | Omnidirectional (unlimited) | From Pawn: 8 pts + 300s alive |

### Special Evolution Pieces

| Piece | Points | Special Abilities | Evolution Path |
|-------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Splitter** | 2 | Can split into 2 pieces, weakens when split | From Pawn: 5 pts + 120s |
| **Vaultbound** | 4 | Captures by vaulting over enemies | From Pawn ‚Üí Knight path |
| **Vaultseer** | 7 | Vaults with 2√ó2 capture area | From Vaultbound: 10 pts + 300s |
| **Vaultarcher** | 9 | Complex vaulting patterns | Advanced evolution |
| **Vaultmistress** | 10 | Master vaulting abilities | Near-ultimate evolution |
| **Covenant Queen** | 12 | Queen + Vaultbound abilities combined | Ultimate evolution: 12 pts + 600s |

### Evolution Decision Tree

```
PAWN (1 pt)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Knight (3 pts) ‚Üí Vaultbound ‚Üí Vaultseer ‚Üí Vaultarcher ‚Üí Vaultmistress ‚Üí Covenant Queen
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bishop (4 pts + 60s) ‚Üí 4-pt Bishop ‚Üí 5-pt Bishop ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Queen
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Rook (4 pts + 60s) ‚Üí 6-pt Rook ‚Üí 7-pt Rook ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Queen  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Splitter (5 pts + 120s) ‚Üí Super Splitter
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Queen (8 pts + 300s) ‚Üí 10-pt Queen ‚Üí Covenant Queen
```

### Strategic Evolution Considerations

1. **Early Game**: Knight/Bishop for mobility
2. **Mid Game**: Rook/Vaultbound for control
3. **Late Game**: Queen/Covenant Queen for dominance
4. **Specialized**: Splitter for numerical advantage
