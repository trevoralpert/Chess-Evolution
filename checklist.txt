- [ ] Add spectator mode and replay system
- [ ] Create AI opponents with different difficulty levels
- [ ] Add lobby system for game matchmaking
- [ ] Implement player statistics and leaderboards

### Phase 6: Polish and Optimization ðŸ“‹ PENDING
- [ ] Performance optimization and code cleanup
- [ ] Advanced graphics and visual effects
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness and touch controls
- [ ] Comprehensive testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Documentation and deployment preparation

## Technical Architecture

### Server Components
- **server/index.js**: Main server logic with Socket.io handlers
- **server/gameConfig.js**: Game configuration and constants
- **server/pieceTypes.js**: Piece definitions and movement patterns
- **public/utils/gridToSphere.js**: Grid-to-sphere coordinate conversion

### Client Components
- **public/index.html**: Main game interface
- **public/main-simple.js**: Core game logic and Three.js rendering
- **public/battleSystem.js**: Battle system UI and interactions

### Asset Management
- **chess piece models/Final pieces/**: GLB 3D models for all pieces
- **image assets/**: 2D images and textures
- All GLB files use UPPERCASE naming with underscores

## Key Features Implemented

### Movement System
- 20x8 grid on sphere surface with latitude/longitude coordinates
- Piece-specific movement patterns with sphere geometry considerations
- Splitter pieces can move OR split (not both in same turn)
- Jumper pieces capture by jumping over enemies (not landing on them)
- Pawns move toward sphere center based on spawn location (Northâ†’South, Southâ†’North)

### Battle System
- Dice-based combat with attack/defense values
- Battle contest system with time limits
- Evolution points from battles and circumnavigation
- Piece transformations and upgrades

### Unique Pieces
- Standard: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn
- Special: Splitter, Jumper, Super Jumper, Hyper Jumper, Mistress Jumper, Hybrid Queen
- Each piece has distinct movement patterns and abilities

### 3D Visualization
- GLB model loading and positioning
- Real-time piece animations and movements
- Visual highlighting for valid moves and special actions
- Dynamic lighting and materials

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- Three.js for 3D graphics
- GLTFLoader for 3D model loading

## Next Steps
1. Implement multi-capture mechanics for evolved jumpers
2. Add Hybrid Queen dual movement system
3. Balance splitter reproduction mechanics
4. Begin Phase 5 advanced features

## Notes
- All GLB files follow UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES naming convention
- Sphere grid system uses normalized coordinates for seamless wrapping
- Battle system includes both immediate and contested resolutions
- Evolution system encourages strategic piece development
- Pawn movement simplified to forward motion on latitude line
