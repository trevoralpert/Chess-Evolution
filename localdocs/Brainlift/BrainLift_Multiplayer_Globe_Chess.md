# 🧠 BrainLift: Multiplayer Globe Chess

## 🎯 Arena

Real-time multiplayer strategy games built with emerging technologies — especially ones with unconventional board designs (e.g. spherical), evolutionary mechanics, and real-time global engagement.

> Not just building a game, but proving AI-augmented developers can break conventional gameplay geometry.

## 💡 Key Insights (Curated with Compression)

1. **Insight**: Wraparound logic simplifies spherical rendering.
   - **Why it matters**: Avoids complex globe physics while preserving gameplay.
   - **New question**: Can players visualize multiple hemispheres simultaneously?

2. **Insight**: Evolutions change the emotional tone of chess.
   - **Why it matters**: Adds RPG-like engagement to a static game.
   - **New question**: How do you balance novelty without overwhelming clarity?

3. **Insight**: Simultaneous moves (every 7 seconds) remove downtime.
   - **Why it matters**: Real-time tension and strategic pressure.
   - **New question**: How to fairly resolve simultaneous conflicts at the same destination?

## ⚔️ Spiky POVs

- “Most chess games are two-dimensional and rigid. But real strategy in the future will be spherical, evolving, and simultaneous.”
- “Stop thinking of the chessboard as a rectangle. Start thinking of it as a world.”
- “Most multiplayer games use linear progression. But evolution and positional transformation are more psychologically rewarding.”
