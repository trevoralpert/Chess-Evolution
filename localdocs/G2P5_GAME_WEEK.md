# 🕹️ G2P5 - Game Week Project Guide

## 📘 Background

Most of you have never built a game before. That's exactly the point.

This week isn't about becoming game developers. It's about proving you can enter completely unfamiliar territory and ship polished, production-quality software using AI as your learning engine.

In the real world, you'll face situations where your boss assigns you to a project using
technologies you've never touched. Maybe it's a legacy system in COBOL. Maybe it's a
cutting-edge framework that launched last month. Maybe it's an industry-specific tool that
nobody on your team has experience with. The question becomes: Can you get up to speed fast
enough to contribute meaningfully?

This project tests your ability to:
- Rapidly acquire expertise in unfamiliar domains using AI  
- Make informed technical decisions without prior experience  
- Build a methodology for AI-accelerated learning  
- Deliver polished results despite starting from zero

We’re using game dev because:
1. It’s likely unfamiliar territory for most
2. Games demand technical excellence
3. The quality bar is immediately visible
4. Multiplayer adds real complexity

## 🎯 Core Challenge

Build a **multiplayer game** using technologies you’ve never worked with before.

You must:
- Learn new tools quickly using AI
- Make fast, informed tech decisions
- Build production-quality multiplayer software
- Prove AI-augmented developers can match or exceed traditional timelines
