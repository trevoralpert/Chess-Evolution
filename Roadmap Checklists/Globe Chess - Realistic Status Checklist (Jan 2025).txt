  - [ ] **BROKEN: Splitter doesn't actually split into two pieces**
  - [x] Jumper variants basic movement works
  - [ ] **UNCLEAR: Other special abilities status unknown**
- [ ] Implement piece evolution system (UI exists but logic incomplete)
- [x] Add visual effects for special moves
- [ ] Create sound effects and enhanced UI (partial implementation)
- [x] Add game rules and help system

## Phase 5: Multiplayer and Game Modes (MOSTLY COMPLETE - 90%)
- [x] Add tournament mode with bracket system
- [x] Implement spectator mode functionality
- [x] Add AI opponents with difficulty levels
- [x] Create lobby system for game organization
- [x] Add statistics tracking infrastructure

## Phase 6: Evolution & Strategy Systems (PARTIALLY COMPLETE - 40%)
- [ ] **BROKEN: Evolution point banking system not working**
- [ ] **BROKEN: Evolution logic not properly implemented**
- [x] Create evolution UI with right-click interface
- [x] Add time-alive tracking for pieces
- [ ] **MISSING: Rarity system implementation**
- [ ] **BROKEN: Battle statistics requirements not enforced**
- [ ] **MISSING: Equator crossing bonus (pawns should get point at midline)**

## Phase 7: Real-Time System & Timing (MOSTLY COMPLETE - 80%)
- [x] Implement individual 7-second move timers for each player
- [x] Add real-time multiplayer system (no turn queue)
- [x] Create collision detection with 500ms window
- [x] Add timer UI with countdown and progress indicators
- [ ] **BROKEN: Move timer logic has bugs**
- [ ] **ISSUE: Timer synchronization problems**

## Phase 8-10: Polish and Visual Improvements (MOSTLY COMPLETE - 85%)
- [x] Visual grid system with alternating colors
- [x] Enhanced lighting for piece visibility
- [x] Piece height positioning fixed
- [x] Color selection system implemented
- [ ] **BROKEN: Auto-camera system has issues**
- [ ] **KNOWN BUG: Cannot drag camera over poles (OrbitControls limitation)**
- [x] UI elements mostly polished

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX (Priority 1)
1. **Splitter Mechanics** - Core feature completely broken
2. **Pawn Capture Logic** - Basic gameplay broken
3. **Battle Feedback** - Players have no idea what's happening in battles
4. **Polar Movement Rules** - Movement around poles is fundamentally broken
5. **Move Timer Bugs** - Timing system has issues

## IMPORTANT ISSUES (Priority 2)
1. **Evolution System** - Points exist but don't work properly
2. **Equator Crossing Bonus** - Missing feature for pawns
3. **Pawn Promotion** - No clear rules for opposite pole
4. **Battle Visualization** - Need dice rolls or clear feedback

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Priority 3)
1. **Camera Polar Restriction** - Can't rotate over poles (Three.js limitation)
2. **Auto-Camera Issues** - System exists but buggy
3. **Sound Effects** - Partial implementation only

## WORKING FEATURES
✅ Basic movement and piece selection
✅ Multiplayer connectivity
✅ AI players can be added
✅ Visual grid and piece rendering
✅ Color selection system
✅ Basic timer system
✅ Chat system
✅ Lobby and game creation

## BROKEN/MISSING FEATURES
❌ Splitter splitting mechanic
❌ Pawn capture logic
❌ Battle feedback system
❌ Polar movement rules
❌ Evolution point system
❌ Equator crossing bonus
❌ Move timer bugs
❌ Camera controls (partial)

## ACTUAL COMPLETION STATUS BY PHASE
- Phase 1: 100% ✅
- Phase 2: 60% ⚠️
- Phase 3: 70% ⚠️
- Phase 4: 50% ⚠️
- Phase 5: 90% ✅
- Phase 6: 40% ❌
- Phase 7: 80% ⚠️
- Phase 8-10: 85% ✅
- **OVERALL: ~75% Complete**

## TOMORROW'S DISCUSSION TOPICS
1. Fix camera issues (auto-camera and polar orbit)
2. Fix move timer logic
3. Fix piece movement/behavior (splitters, pawn capture)
4. Design polar cap movement rules
5. Implement evolution logic and points
6. Add equator crossing bonus

## RECENT FIXES (Session 2 - January 2025)
- [x] Fixed AI difficulty crash
- [x] Fixed socket connection stability
- [x] Fixed green move dot clicking
- [x] Fixed duplicate AI player creation

## NOTES
- The game has a solid foundation but several core mechanics are broken
- UI/Visual polish is mostly complete
- Multiplayer infrastructure works well
- Main issues are with game logic, not technical infrastructure
