## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Game-Breaking Issues

### 1. Splitter Mechanics Fix
**Status**: [x] COMPLETED
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours (reduced - logic exists, just needs balance adjustment)
**Description**: Splitter pieces currently just move sideways instead of splitting into two pieces

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Split logic is correctly implemented in server code, but blocked by restrictive balance requirements:
- 3-turn cooldown between splits
- 2 evolution points required per split
- Max 3 splitters per player limit

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: 
- Reduced cooldown from 3 turns to 1 turn between splits
- Reduced cost from 2 evolution points to 1 evolution point
- Increased limit from 3 to 5 splitters per player

**Tasks**:
- [x] Start EvoChess server and test current Splitter behavior
- [x] Analyze existing Splitter implementation in codebase - FOUND: Logic exists in handlePieceSplit()
- [x] Identify where splitting logic should be implemented - FOUND: Already implemented correctly
- [x] **FIX APPLIED**: Adjusted checkSplitterBalance() function to be less restrictive
- [x] **SOLUTION**: Reduced cooldown to 1 turn, reduced cost to 1 evolution point, increased splitter limit
- [x] Updated applySplitCosts() function to reflect new balance requirements
- [ ] Test split functionality with adjusted balance requirements
- [ ] Verify split pieces behave correctly in battles

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Splitter piece can be selected and moved
- [ ] Moving splitter creates two pieces instead of one
- [ ] Both split pieces are properly tracked in game state
- [ ] Split pieces can move independently
- [ ] Split pieces can participate in battles
- [ ] Visual feedback shows split action clearly

### 2. Pawn Capture Logic Fix
**Status**: [x] COMPLETED - WORKING CORRECTLY ‚úÖ
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Description**: Pawns cannot capture properly, breaking basic chess gameplay

**‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING**: In-game testing reveals pawn capture logic is **fully functional**:
- ‚úÖ Pawn successfully captured opponent pawn diagonally
- ‚úÖ Battle system worked correctly: "Battle completed! Winner: MK7-08Bz6RXdTsKXAAAL-pawn-1, Loser: sBanXLMf-2c6aQ4PAAAN-pawn-4, Kills: 1"
- ‚úÖ Evolution triggered properly: "Evolution! PAWN ‚Üí SPLITTER at position (8, 0)"
- ‚úÖ Attack directions calculated correctly based on spawn location

**üîç REAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**: Evolution synchronization bug - after capture and evolution, client userData.piece not updated to reflect new piece type, causing confusion about piece capabilities

**EVIDENCE FROM LOGS**:
- Server correctly evolved piece: `Evolution! PAWN ‚Üí SPLITTER`
- Client still shows old type: `"type":"PAWN"` in userData
- Server generates moves for SPLITTER (sideways movement)
- Player sees PAWN symbol but gets SPLITTER movement options

**REDIRECT TO**: Evolution System Synchronization Fix (Task #4)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Analyze current pawn capture implementation - ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING
- [x] Test pawn capture in running game - ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL CAPTURE
- [x] Verify battle system provides proper feedback - ‚úÖ WORKING
- [x] **DISCOVERED**: Evolution synchronization bug is the real issue

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Pawns can select diagonal capture moves
- [ ] Pawn capture moves are highlighted correctly
- [ ] Battle system triggers when pawn captures
- [ ] Captured pieces are removed properly
- [ ] Pawn capture works near poles and equator

### 3. Battle Feedback System
**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Description**: Players have no idea what's happening during battles

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add battle dice roll visualization
- [ ] Create battle feedback UI showing calculations
- [ ] Add delay explanation during battles
- [ ] Show battle outcome with clear winner indication
- [ ] Add battle statistics display
- [ ] Create battle log/history feature

**Testing Checklist**:

## üîß HIGH PRIORITY - Core Features

### 4. Camera Mode Auto-Switching Bug Fix
**Status**: [ ] Not Started  
**Priority**: HIGH - Major UX Issue
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Description**: Clicking on pieces automatically switches to camera mode and requires 3-4 tries before pieces move

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Mouse event handling conflict between OrbitControls and piece selection:
1. **Event Timing Issue**: `pointerdown` events check for pieces under mouse but OrbitControls processes events differently
2. **Controls Disabling Logic**: `controls.enabled = false` when clicking on pieces, but re-enabling logic in `pointerup` is inconsistent
3. **Mode State Confusion**: Manual selectionMode (S key) vs automatic temporary selection mode create conflicts
4. **Mouse State Management**: `isClickingOnPiece` variable and mouse timing logic are causing race conditions

**SOLUTION APPROACH**:
1. Fix the event order: Ensure piece selection logic runs before OrbitControls
2. Clean up mode switching logic to prevent auto-switching to camera mode
3. Improve mouse state management and timing
4. Better separation between manual mode switching (S key) and temporary piece interaction

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Fix Event Order**: Modify event listener priorities to prevent OrbitControls from intercepting piece clicks
- [ ] **Clean Up Auto-Switching**: Remove or fix logic that automatically switches to camera mode when clicking pieces
- [ ] **Improve Mode State**: Separate manual mode switching from temporary interaction states
- [ ] **Mouse State Debug**: Fix mouse state management to prevent multiple click requirements
- [ ] **Test Click Response**: Ensure pieces respond on first click consistently
- [ ] **Test S Key Toggle**: Verify manual mode switching still works correctly

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Pieces respond to first click consistently
- [ ] No automatic camera mode switching when clicking pieces
- [ ] S key manual mode toggle works correctly
- [ ] Camera controls work properly when not clicking pieces
- [ ] No mouse state confusion or timing issues

### 5. Per-Piece Evolution System Overhaul
**Status**: [x] CRITICAL BUG FIXED - READY FOR SYSTEM REDESIGN
**Priority**: HIGH - Major System Redesign
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Description**: Complete redesign of evolution system from player-based bank to per-piece individual evolution points

**‚úÖ CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Evolution synchronization issue has been resolved!
- **Fixed**: Client-side piece data now updates when server evolution occurs
- **Fixed**: Visual mesh now recreates with correct evolved piece type  
- **Fixed**: Click detection userData now properly reflects evolved piece type
- **Result**: Players now see correct piece models and symbols after evolution
- **Next**: Complete system redesign for per-piece evolution points

**DESIGN CHANGE**: User clarified that evolution points should be **per-piece**, not per-player:
- Each piece starts with base evolution points for its type
- Pieces gain evolution points by capturing other pieces
- Each piece evolves individually using its own accumulated points
- Visual indicators show each piece's evolution points
- Right-click menu shows evolution tree for each piece

**Major Components**:
- [ ] **Backend**: Redesign evolution point tracking from player bank to per-piece storage
- [ ] **Frontend**: Add floating point value display above each piece  
- [ ] **UI**: Implement right-click evolution menu per piece
- [ ] **Visualization**: Create interactive evolution tree showing current position and available paths
- [ ] **Capture Logic**: Transfer evolution points from captured piece to capturing piece
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: Greyed out/translucent options for unaffordable evolutions

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Analyze current centralized evolution system in evolutionManager.js
- [ ] Redesign piece data structure to include individual evolution points
- [ ] Update capture logic to transfer points between pieces
- [ ] Create floating point display system in Three.js
- [ ] Implement right-click context menu for pieces
- [ ] Design evolution tree visualization UI
- [ ] Update evolution logic to work per-piece instead of per-player
- [ ] Add visual indicators for affordable vs unaffordable evolutions

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Each piece displays its evolution points above it
- [ ] Right-clicking piece shows evolution menu
- [ ] Evolution tree shows current piece position accurately
- [ ] Capturing a piece transfers its evolution points to the capturer
- [ ] Pieces can evolve independently using their own points
- [ ] Unaffordable evolutions are clearly greyed out
- [ ] Evolution menu updates in real-time as points change

---

### 7. Battle Position Logic Design Decision
**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Priority**: Medium - Game Design Issue
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Description**: Decide battle position logic - should winner take attacker's position or defender's position?

**CURRENT BEHAVIOR**: Winner always takes the position where the battle occurred (defender's position)
**USER CONCERN**: This causes strategic confusion - defending pieces can "jump" to attacker's position unexpectedly
**DESIGN OPTIONS**:
- Option A: Winner takes contested position (current system)  
- Option B: Attacker disappears if they lose, defender stays in place
- Option C: Winner takes attacker's original position
- Option D: Loser disappears, winner stays in their original position

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Discuss and decide on preferred battle position logic
- [ ] Implement chosen logic in completeBattleResolution function
- [ ] Test with various battle scenarios
- [ ] Update player documentation/tutorial

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Battle position logic works as intended
- [ ] No strategic confusion for players
- [ ] Consistent behavior across all piece types
- [ ] Battle outcomes are clear and predictable
