# Globe Chess - Tomorrow's TODO List

## HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (Game Breaking)

### 1. Splitter Mechanics
- [ ] Implement actual splitting behavior (create two pieces)
- [ ] Fix movement to be split, not sideways
- [ ] Add visual feedback for split action
- [ ] Test split piece tracking and management

### 2. Pawn Capture System
- [ ] Debug why pawns can't capture properly
- [ ] Add battle dice roll visualization
- [ ] Create battle feedback UI (show calculations)
- [ ] Add delay explanation during battles
- [ ] Test diagonal capture movements

### 3. Polar Movement Rules
- [ ] Define clear movement rules around polar caps
- [ ] Fix king vulnerability at poles (pawns can't check)
- [ ] Decide on pawn promotion rules (at outer ring?)
- [ ] Implement and test polar movement logic
- [ ] Consider special polar position rules

### 4. Move Timer Logic
- [ ] Debug timer synchronization issues
- [ ] Fix timer-related movement bugs
- [ ] Ensure moves only allowed when timer at 0
- [ ] Test timer behavior with multiple players
- [ ] Fix any edge cases with timer expiration

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (Core Features)

### 5. Evolution System
- [ ] Fix evolution point accumulation
- [ ] Implement evolution logic properly
- [ ] Test evolution UI functionality
- [ ] Add visual feedback for evolution
- [ ] Verify point banking system

### 6. Equator Crossing Bonus
- [ ] Add point award for pawns crossing midline
- [ ] Create visual feedback for bonus
- [ ] Test with multiple pieces
- [ ] Update UI to show bonus points
- [ ] Add to tutorial/help system

## LOW PRIORITY (Polish)

### 7. Camera System
- [ ] Fix auto-camera issues
- [ ] Investigate polar orbit restriction workaround
- [ ] Test camera behavior in different scenarios
- [ ] Consider alternative camera control options

### 8. Battle Visualization
- [ ] Design dice roll animation
- [ ] Create battle calculation display
- [ ] Add sound effects for battles
- [ ] Improve battle outcome clarity

## DISCUSSION TOPICS

1. **Polar Cap Design Philosophy**
   - Should kings at poles be safer?
   - How do we balance polar positions?
   - Special rules for polar movement?

2. **Pawn Promotion Mechanics**
   - Promote at outer ring or opposite pole?
   - What pieces can pawns promote to?
   - Evolution points for promotion?

3. **Battle System Transparency**
   - How much math to show players?
   - Quick mode vs detailed battle view?
   - Battle history/replay?

4. **Evolution Strategy**
   - Point costs for different evolutions?
   - Strategic timing of evolutions?
   - Visual indicators for evolution readiness?

## TESTING CHECKLIST
- [ ] Test with 2 human players
- [ ] Test with 4+ AI players
- [ ] Test all piece types thoroughly
- [ ] Test polar positions extensively
- [ ] Test evolution scenarios
- [ ] Test battle edge cases
- [ ] Test timer edge cases

## NOTES FOR DISCUSSION
- Consider simplified rule variants for casual play
- Think about tutorial/onboarding for complex mechanics
- Discuss long-term feature roadmap
- Review player feedback priorities
