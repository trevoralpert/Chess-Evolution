## 🎯 What Makes EvoChess Unique

EvoChess reimagines chess for the modern era by breaking fundamental constraints through innovative gameplay and AI-powered development:

### 1. 🌐 **Spherical Board** 
- Play on a 20×8 globe grid (160 positions) instead of a flat 8×8 board
- **No edges or corners** - longitude wraps around seamlessly
- **Polar dynamics** - North and South poles become strategic strongholds
- **True 3D gameplay** - Rotate the globe to view from any angle

### 2. 🧬 **Evolving Pieces**
- Pieces gain **evolution points** through combat and achievements
- **15+ evolution paths** - Transform pawns into powerful variants
- **Strategic banking** - Save points for major upgrades
- **Time-based evolution** - Some evolutions require survival time

### 3. ♟️ **Original Pieces with New Logic**
- **Vaultbound Family**: Pieces that capture by vaulting over enemies
  - Vaultbound → Vaultseer → Vaultarcher → Vaultmistress
- **Splitter**: Can divide into two weaker pieces
- **Covenant Queen**: Ultimate evolution combining Queen + Vaultbound abilities
- **Circumnavigation bonus**: +8 points for reaching the opposite pole

### 4. 🎨 **Custom 3D Assets**
- **Original 3D models** generated using [Meshy.ai](https://www.meshy.ai/)
- **Unique visual identity** - Every piece has a distinctive, professional design
- **AI-powered asset creation** - Demonstrating innovation in both gameplay and development

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- 2GB RAM minimum

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/trevoralpert/Chess-Evolution.git
cd Chess-Evolution

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open in browser
http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Start production server
npm start
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** - JavaScript runtime
- **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)** - Web application framework
- **[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Custom Game Engine** - Handles game logic, timing, and state management

### Frontend
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** - 3D graphics library for WebGL
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework dependencies for maximum performance
- **[GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader)** - Loads professional 3D models
- **WebGL** - Hardware-accelerated 3D rendering

### Asset Creation
- **[Meshy.ai](https://www.meshy.ai/)** - AI-powered 3D model generation for all custom pieces
- **GLB Format** - Optimized 3D models with textures and materials

### Architecture
- **Real-time Multiplayer** - WebSocket-based with delta updates
- **Modular System Design** - Separate managers for timing, evolution, battles
- **Event-driven Architecture** - Decoupled components via Socket.io events
- **Performance Optimized** - Object pooling, frustum culling, instanced rendering

## 🎮 How to Play

### Basic Controls
- **Left Click** - Select piece and move
- **Right Click** - Open evolution menu
- **Drag** - Rotate the globe
- **Scroll** - Zoom in/out

### Core Mechanics
1. **Real-time Movement** - 7-second cooldown after each move (no turns!)
2. **Battle System** - Higher value pieces win, but underdogs can contest with dice
3. **Evolution Points** - Earn through combat, use to transform pieces
4. **Victory** - Capture the enemy King or be the last player standing
