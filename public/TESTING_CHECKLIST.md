# Testing Checklist for Modular Architecture

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Create Testing Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/modular-architecture
git add .
git commit -m "Refactor: Break down main-simple.js into modular architecture

- Split 7000+ line file into 8 focused modules
- Implement event-driven inter-module communication
- Preserve all original functionality
- Add comprehensive documentation"
```

### 2. Update HTML File
**IMPORTANT**: Change the script tag in `public/index.html`:

**Find line 534:**
```html
<script src="./main-simple.js?v=23&debug=true"></script>
```

**Replace with:**
```html
<script type="module" src="./main-simple-modular.js?v=24&debug=true"></script>
```

## Debugging Tools

### Console Commands for Testing
Open browser console and test these:

```javascript
// Check module initialization
console.log('Modules loaded:', {
  gameInit: !!window.gameInit,
  socketManager: !!window.socketManager,
  sceneManager: !!window.sceneManager,
  gameStateManager: !!window.gameStateManager,
  mouseInteraction: !!window.mouseInteraction,
  pieceMeshManager: !!window.pieceMeshManager,
  visualEffects: !!window.visualEffects,
  uiManager: !!window.uiManager
});

// Check game state
console.log('Game State:', window.gameStateManager?.gameState);

// Check piece meshes
console.log('Piece Meshes:', Object.keys(window.pieceMeshManager?.pieceMeshes || {}));

// Test notification system
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('showNotification', {
  detail: { message: 'Test notification!', color: '#00ff00', duration: 2000 }
}));
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are found:

### Quick Rollback
1. Change HTML back to original script:
   ```html
   <script src="./main-simple.js?v=23&debug=true"></script>
   ```

### Full Rollback
```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/modular-architecture  # if needed
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… **All core functionality working**
âœ… **No console errors**
âœ… **Smooth performance**
âœ… **Visual parity with original**
âœ… **All game features functional**

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Module Loading Errors
- Ensure all file paths are correct
- Check that all modules export their classes properly
- Verify import statements match export names

### Event Communication Issues
- Check that events are dispatched with correct names
- Verify event listeners are set up properly
- Use browser dev tools to monitor custom events

### 3D Rendering Issues
- Check WebGL support in browser
- Verify Three.js is loaded before modules
- Check for WebGL context errors

### Socket Connection Issues
- Verify server is running
- Check network connectivity
- Monitor socket events in browser dev tools

## Final Notes

- Test thoroughly in a development environment first
- Keep the original `main-simple.js` as backup
- Monitor console output during all testing
- Document any issues found for future reference

Good luck with testing! ðŸš€
